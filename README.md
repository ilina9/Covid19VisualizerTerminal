Homework project for Python course

Issues to be fixed:
- Upon running main.py, when clicking on the desired action, matplotlib actions run twice the first time (one window popping up after another)
- Search based on country functionality in the file is allowing search only once, then bugs (other actions remain functionable)
- Add scroll functionality to buttons
