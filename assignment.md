# Homework Assignment: Data Analysis and Visualization Tool

## Problem Statement:
Your task is to develop a Data Analysis and Visualization Tool capable of scrutinizing a dataset detailing COVID-19 cases. The dataset (`covid_data.csv`) encompasses essential columns: date, country, confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

## Features:

1. Dataset Loading: Import the dataset (`covid_data.csv`) into your program using Pandas.
2. Summary Statistics View: Present an overview of the dataset, encompassing total confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, etc.
3. Daily Cases Plotting: Construct a line graph illustrating the daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
4. Top 10 Countries Plot: Generate a bar chart spotlighting the top 10 countries with the highest confirmed cases count.
5. Country-wise Search: Enable users to input a country's name and visualize the trajectory of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for that specific country.
6. Exit Option: Provide users with the option to gracefully exit the program.
7. Implement Additional Functionality: Incorporate supplementary features as deemed necessary.

## Solution

Your solution should adhere to the fundamental principles covered in the course, such as modularized code, adherence to the single responsibility principle, and maintenance of clean code standards. The entire solution should be under version control and uploaded to a remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, or any other preferred hosting service).
